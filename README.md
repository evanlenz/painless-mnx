# painless-mnx
This software converts [MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/) documents to [MNX](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/) format using XSLT.

See [MNX by example](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/by-example/) and the [MNX Draft Specification](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/specification/common/).

Inspired by the question "Why not XSLT?" and Adrian Holovaty's invitation given here: https://youtu.be/x2OZ5i2oD8U?t=5749
